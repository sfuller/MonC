# MonC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sfuller/MonC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sfuller/MonC)
"MonC" is a toy programming language. It's heavily inspired by C.

## Design Goals
* Easy to learn for those not versed in programming.
* Keep it super simple.
* Prevent mistakes at compile time.
* Don't assume. (Avoid implicit conversions, etc)

## Language Features (So far)
* Common Flow Control Functionality (if/else, for, while, continue, break, return)
* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Function Definitions and Calls
* Strong Typing
* Structured Data Types (Structs)

## Planned / In-Progress Features
* [Various types of pointers with different semantics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSsLtkBjWtqz0j9bsSm7BcSHcH8IH5qCxbH-tuotP5k/edit?usp=sharing)
* Metaprogramming Interface (Just a dream at this point)

## Whats missing? (Right now)
* Language Level Memory Management
* Indirect Function Calls
